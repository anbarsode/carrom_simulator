    "If a coin is on the board, the location of the only hole it may immediately collide with is fixed by the direction of its velocity. A coin moving towards, for example, +x and -y direction (i.e. $sign(\\textbf{v}) = (+1, -1)$ will never enter a hole located at, say, $\\left(-\\frac{L}{2}+R_{h},\\ -\\frac{L}{2}+R_{h}\\right)$. The only hole a coin may collide with is given by $\\left((\\frac{L}{2}-R_{h})\\times sign(v_x),\\ (\\frac{L}{2}-R_{h})\\times sign(v_y)\\right)$.  \n",

    "The collision is similar to any other coin-coin collision except that the hole can allow the coin to enter its disk. The collision is said to occur (assumption 1 in section 1.4) when the distance between the centers of the coin and the hole is equal to $R_{h}$. This can be accomplished by the simple coin-coin collision detection module by setting the hole's radius $R_{hole}$ equal to $R_{h}-R_{coin}$. Note that any coin outside a particular hole can never collide with the fillet bounding that hole without passing through that hole first.  \n",

The velocities remain constant because there is no friction inside the hole. A coin will collide with a fillet if the two endpoints $P_1$ and $P_2$ are on different sides of the linear trajectory of the coin. This can be easily checked by calculating and comparing the signs of $l(\\textbf{P}_1)$ and $l(\\textbf{P}_2)$. If the signs are equal, the coin will not collide with the fillet and vice versa. Moreover, since both incoming and outgoing directions give opposite signs for $l(\\textbf{P}_1)$ and $l(\\textbf{P}_2)$, for the collision to occur, the coin must be moving in the same general direction of the fillet given by the sign of its velocity components (similar to how a coin must move in the same general direction of the hole's center's location in order to enter it).  \n",

Here, there is an additional complication that the coin-coin collision detector deals with full disks whereas the fillet occupies only a quarter of the hole.

This is a $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ process and the simulations take a lot of time to run for a large number of particles.
